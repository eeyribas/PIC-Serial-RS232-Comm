# PIC-Serial-RS232-Comm
Contains an application of Serial (RS232) communication with a PIC microcontroller. The PIC processor sends the integer value of "5" over Serial (RS232) communication. 
Serial (RS232) communication occurs through the pins of the PIC microcontroller.

IDE Version: PIC C Compiler (CCS C Compiler) v5.008

PIC Used: PIC18F4550

Datasheets: The PIC18F4450 pinout diagram is shown in the image (PIC18f4550.png). Serial (RS232) communication between the PIC processor and the PC can be tested. 
The connection between the PIC and the PC is shown in the image (PIC-USB Connection.png).
